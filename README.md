How many tutorials does it take to become good at something? Way too many. How many times do you want to follow along these tutorials, probably all the time. I made this repo just for following along tutorials because I learn better that way. I just create a new branch for each fun little project. Probably not the best strategy maybe folder per tutorial is better so i'll do that actually.
